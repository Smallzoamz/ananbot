# Findings: Hero Banner Design Research 🔍

## Current Implementation Issues
- Bouncing icons look dated and disconnected.
- Sitting mascots interfere with UI (buried under cards, hidden under header).
- Movement is too linear (bounce-x, bounce-y).

## Design Ideas (Mascot-Free)
- **Mesh Gradients:** Fluid movement of colors, high-end feel.
- **Glass Blobs:** Abstract shapes with backdrop-blur.
- **Circuit/Grid:** Tech-themed glowing lines.
